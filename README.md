# üêï Dog breed classification 

[Link to the main classification notebook on nbviewer.](https://nbviewer.org/github/ana-bernal/P6_img-classif/blob/main/02_classification.ipynb).

As a first exercice with convolutionnal neural networks I built some models from scratch and also used transfer learning from architectures [VGG16](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/#vgg16-function) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)) and [EfficientNetV2S](https://keras.io/api/applications/efficientnet_v2/#efficientnetv2s-function) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298)).

A Hugging Face space for classification using the best performing model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ana-bernal/DogBreedClassification).
